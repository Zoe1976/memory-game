memeory game using HTML, CSS and basic JAVASCRIPT

HTML--
The HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code will help us to prepare a game board and the necessary elements to create the structure.

CSS--
The CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) code will help to style the project with suitable bgcolor and some alignment to the necessary elements.

JAVASCRPIT--
Then the JS(JavaScript) code will contain the images of the game and then weâ€™ll make it a grid and some functions to make it responsive at the user end.

I hope you have got an idea about the project.
